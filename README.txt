Assignment 1

The following files are my submission for COMP SCI 303's "Assignment 1", which takes in a given .txt file containing numerical values and stores them in an array.

TABLE OF CONTENTS:

- TextFile2.txt: Contains numerical values that is used by the program to allow manipulation from a user.
- 301Assignment1.cpp: Contains the menu for the user and calls different functionalities, depending on input.
- Functions.cpp: Contains code & definitions for the separate functionalities used within the program.
- Functions.h: Contains the declarations for functions used within the program.

GUIDE:
	Upon running the program, you are greeted and asked how you would like to manipulate the data set given to you. You must input the letter choices given to you, otherwise the program will ask you again to make
	a choice.

	NOTE: Besides the main menu, all user input should be numerical. An attempt to input data other than digits will result in an error and will request that you redo your selection.
